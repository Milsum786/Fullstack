<p><b>Wow</b></p>
<p>A BIG political moment.</p>
<p>For something that wasn't even technically a Budget, it was one heck of a statement of intent from the new prime minister and new chancellor.</p>
<p>And it is a gamble.</p>
<p>A massive leap in a new direction.</p>
<p>It amounts to the wholesale shredding of previous economic policy: both<br>the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years<br> (which Liz Truss sat within for most of that time) and those of Labour<br> before that.</p>
<p>It is an all-or-nothing strategy, where the prime minister will own the consequences, good or bad.</p>
