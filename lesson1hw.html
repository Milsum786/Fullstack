            </p>What exactly is a computer programmer? Computer programmers write code. They<br> write code to design programs.This may sound vague, but computer programming is a<br>vast field with many different specializations. In order to effectively include all of the<br> database managers, web developers, systems analysts, and application devs, it is easier<br> to group them under the umbrella of “computer programmers.”

            <p>If you love writing code, computer programming might be for you. In this article we’ll<br> discuss steps it takes to become a computer programmer. We’ll break down each step<br> in detail so you’ll have a better understanding of what the work itself will look like. You<br> may have seen some of our longer guides on finding a job in the tech industry like <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer" target="blank">How<br> to become a full-stack developer</a> or <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/data-engineer-career" target="blank">How to become a data engineer.</a> This article will<br> cover similar steps to these guides, but we’ll dive a little deeper into the weeds of each<br> one.

            <p>Coders don’t necessarily have to be professionals to be considered computer<br>programmers. There are plenty of hobbyists out there that, according to our definition<br> of computer programming, make the grade. Even so, we’ll focus on the path to finding a<br> computer programming career.

            <p>To the uninitiated, computer science and software engineering describe two very<br> similar disciplines. In reality, these two fields are completely different. Computer<br> science is centered around learning general computational principles and applying<br> them to a range of fields like machine learning, database management, and<br> information security. Software engineering on the other hand is engineering oriented<br> and revolves around the practical skills necessary to design, develop, and maintain<br> software systems.</p>

            <p>Similarly, the role of a computer programmer and a software engineer are quite<br> different. As previously mentioned, programmers typically work in a more specialized<br> area of the development process. They are responsible for writing code and building<br> software. Software engineers are still very much involved in the development process,<br> but they are more likely to oversee broader areas as well. Software engineers are often<br> responsible for conception of an idea, troubleshooting, and implementation as<br> well as development.</p>

            <p>Coders and computer programmers occupy a unique position in the job market. It is<br> common for large high-paying organizations to not require a computer programming<br> degree or other bespoke education requirements. As long as you present the hiring<br> team with a resume and portfolio of projects you’ve worked on, and are able to pass a<br> technical interview, many companies don’t care if you don’t have a degree.</p>

            <h1>What kind of programmer do you want to be?</h1>

            <p>There are so many different flavors of programming that if you<br> love to code, it may be daunting to determine what you want to<br> pursue as a career. The best way to find out what you like to try<br> as much as you can.</p>

            <p>Just a few types of programmer jobs to look into are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Software application development</li>
                <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/beginner-guide-to-web-dev">
                <li>web development</li></a>
                <li>Front end, back-end, and full-stack</li>
                <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/exploring-data-science-with-microsofts-applied-ai-engineer"><li>Data science and machine learning</li></a>
                <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/database-design-tutorial"><li>Database administrator</li></a>
                li>system design</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Each of these disciplines require slightly different skills. Seek out as much as you<br>can with respect to all the different fields, and remember that nothing is set in stone. If, in<br> your education, you find that web development is not what you find interesting and<br> would prefer to spend your time training artificial intelligence and studying neural<br> networks, allow yourself the the time to pivot. The world of computer programming is<br> so diverse that it can be hard to find a niche, but it is very rewarding once you settle.</p>
